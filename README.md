Mitchell Fontaine

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Answer: Artemis Financial, a financial planning consultancy, seeks to revolutionize its operations by utilizing cutting-edge technology. To ensure the success of its tailored software solutions, the company is committed to integrating state-of-the-art security measures, guaranteeing the protection of sensitive client information and maintaining the highest standards of digital integrity.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Answer: I did well in runnning dependency checks and writing secure code. Coding securely is crucial because it protects a company's software, data, and users from cyber threats, attacks, and breaches. Secure coding practices help prevent vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited. By placing software security at the forefront, a company can significantly mitigate the risk of cyber threats, safeguard its valuable assets, and foster a culture of trust with its customers, resulting in long-term success.


Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Answer: The dependency-check tool we used was very helpful to me. It allowed me the chance to utilize a tool I had never used before and learn how it helps identify vulnerabilities.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Answer: I was able to increase layers of security by updating libraries which contained vulnerabilities in the outdated versions. To assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques, I would utilize vulnerability scanning, pen testing, and dependency management tools.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Answer: Throughout the software development process, I iteratively tested and debugged the code to guarantee its functionality and stability. Following code refactoring, I conducted a subsequent vulnerability assessment to verify that no new weaknesses were introduced, ensuring the software's security and integrity.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Answer: Using Maven was very helpful and will use it in the future if I am using Java.


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Answer: I might show future employers the hash function I used.
